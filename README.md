LEVI is an intelligent optimizer that recognizes WHERE optimization is possible:  - For standard operations (Matrix Mult): No deterioration ✓ - For memory-bound operations: Up to 27x speedup ✓ - For reductions: 6.5x speedup ✓  LEVI's value: It KNOWS when to optimize and when not to. Developers don't have to guess—LEVI decides automatically.
